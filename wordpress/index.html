The Fourth International Conference on Mathematics and Computation in 
Music will be held June 12-14 2013 at McGill University in Montreal, 
Canada.

<br /><br />

MCM 2013 continues the tradition of biennial international conferences of 
the <a
href="http://www.smcm-net.info/">Society for Mathematics and 
Computation in Music</a>
held on 
alternating sides of the Atlantic. It is hosted jointly by the 
<a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/music/">Schulich School of Music</a> at 
McGill University, and by <a 
href="http://www.cirmmt.mcgill.ca/">CIRMMT</a>, 
the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in 
Music Media and Technology. The conference will take place in conjunction 
with a concert produced by the live@CIRMMT series.
<br /><br />   

The disciplines of Mathematics and Music share an intertwined history 
stretching back two and a half millennia. More recently, informatics has 
made possible new approaches to these disciplines, often with 
transformative effect. MCM conferences promote the collaboration and 
exchange of ideas among researchers in music theory, mathematics, computer 
science, musicology, cognition, and other related fields. The organisers 
of MCM 2013 encourage submissions of unpublished papers that use 
mathematical and/or computational approaches to address any aspect of 
music theory, music analysis, or composition, by researchers or teams of 
researchers in any related field. Contributions may be in the form of 
individual papers (20 mins, with 10 additional minutes reserved for 
questions and discussion), panels and joint sessions, workshops and 
tutorials, or posters. Proposals are due on January 14 2013, and may be 
submitted as PDF files at <a 
href="http://senldogo0039.springer-sbm.com/ocs/home/MCM2013">this page</a> 
on the conference service site. <br /><br />

Proposals should take the form of a complete paper of any length up to 12 
pages. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in an edited volume 
in the series <a href="www.springer.com/lncs"><i>Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science</i></a>, as were the Proceedings from the 2009 and 2011 MCM 
meetings. Information for authors <a 
href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">may be 
found here</a>, including formatting guidelines and author templates for 
<a 
href="ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/word/splnproc1110.zip">Word 
2007</a>, <a 
href="http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/CSProceedings_AuthorTools_Word_2003.zip?SGWID=0-0-45-1124637-0">Word 
2003</a> and <a 
href="http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/svmono.zip?SGWID=0-0-45-72921-0">LaTeX</a>. 
For initial submission we strongly encourage use of the Springer templates 
for formatting; final resubmissions after the program committee review can 
only be accepted if they are correctly formatted for the Proceedings.

<br /><br /> Proposals for individual papers will automatically be 
considered for poster presentation if they are not accepted as papers.
